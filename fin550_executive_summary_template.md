## Case Overview

Concisely describe the problem and your objectives as a data scientist on the team.

_Example prompts:_
- What business or policy problem is the Cook County Assessor’s Office facing?
- How does your modeling work help address that problem?
- What are your high-level goals for model performance and fairness?

## Methodology

Describe the data approach and methodology you use. Justify your choice of methodology.  
You should be precise but avoid jargon. This is a document that will potentially be shared with the data science team at CCAO, so make sure the language is clear, professional, and appropriate for them.

Suggested elements to cover:

- Data sources and key variables used  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, outliers)  
- Modeling approaches considered (e.g., linear models, tree-based models, ensemble methods)  
- Model selection, validation strategy, and performance metrics (e.g., train/validation split, cross-validation, MSE)  
- Any fairness, robustness, or interpretability considerations

## Conclusion

Describe your results, including summary statistics (e.g., min, max, mean, and quartiles) of the distribution of assessed property values. Describe your data file which reports the assessed property values you have generated.

You should:

- Summarize your model’s out-of-sample performance (e.g., MSE)  
- Comment on any systematic biases or notable patterns you observe  
- Provide key descriptive statistics for the assessed values you submit  
- State any recommendations for the Cook County Assessor’s Office based on your findings

## Appendix

Include tables and plots here. Enumerate each table and plot, give each a descriptive title, and make sure elements are labeled clearly. Tables and plots should correspond to output from your code.

You may organize your appendix as follows:

### Table A1. [Title]

```markdown
[Paste or describe Table A1 here.]
```

### Figure A1. [Title]

```markdown
[Paste or describe Figure A1 here.]
```

_Add further tables/figures as needed (A2, A3, etc.)._
